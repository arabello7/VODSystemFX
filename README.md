## Running

When running for the first time I recommend to click 'cancel'. Users will be created automaticaly with program start. Distributors must be added manualy ('New Distributor') so they can create products and add them to the system. At least one distributor must exist so you can add products by yourself ('New Product'). You can also add new users ('New User').

By clicking the object on the list you get details about it with possibility to delete the object. Products list can be searched using right panel. Lists can be refreshed using special button but also when hovering the mouse on 1st or 2nd list so it's important to move the cursor actively to be up to date with the system. 

('Subscription Pricing') button opens the window where you can change pricing of monthly subscriptions for users. It's also the way to trigger system bankcrupcy which ends program after 3 months of negative financial flow (worth trying!). On the right side there is field with current account balance.

I recommend to run the program in the compiler to see details of every action in output.
